On Aug. 9, 2022, the RBA announced a collaboration with the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) to explore CBDC use cases for Australia. The joint research resulted in the launch of a project to test a general-purpose pilot CBDC. As outlined in the ‘Australian CBDC Pilot for Digital Finance Innovation’ white paper:
> The key objectives of the project are to identify and understand innovative 
> business models, use cases, benefits, risks, and operational models for a CBDC > in Australia.
As a central bank, the RBA will be responsible for the issuance of eAUD, while the DFCRC will oversee the development and installation of the eAUD platform. Industry participants can join the pilot as use case providers once approved for implementation.

On Sept 6, 2022, Australia’s ministerial department of Treasury approached the general public for their opinion on taxing cryptocurrencies. Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones revealed the intention to exclude crypto assets from being taxed as a foreign currency.

Australian investors were provided with a window of 25 days to share their opinion on this decision.
